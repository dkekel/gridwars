Q: What programming language can I use?
A: You need to use Java 8.

Q: Can I used 3rd party Java libs?
A: Sorry, but no. It's just you, your brain, your team and the standard Java API.

Q: Is there a size limit for the bot jar upload?
A: Yes, it's 5 MB. This is way more than enough when not using 3rd party libs. The size of your jar file is typically just a few KBs.

Q: Is there a memory limitation for the execution of a match?
A: Yes, the match JVM processes are running with 256 MB of heap space, shared by both bots and the execution engine.

Q: Is there a timeout on bot initialisation?
A: Yes, it's 5 seconds.

Q: Is there a timeout per turn?
A: Yes, it's 50 milliseconds. If you fail to provide a result within this time, no movement commands will be executed for that turn.

Q: Is there a timout for the whole match?
A: Yes, it's XX seconds. If the match takes longer, it will be considered as failed and will not be considered for the rank calculation.

Q: Can I output logs for my bot?
A: Yes, you can simply write to stdout and/or stderr (System.out.println, System.err.println). The output will be redirected to a file that you can download from the match view page. You can only download the output file of your bot. Please note that the maximal total text that you are allowed to write is 5 MB. If you try to print more, any further output will simply be discarded.

Q: Can I read or write files on the file system?
A: No.

Q: Can I use reflections?
A: No, if you are getting caught trying, you will lose the turn.

Q: Can I use threads?
A: No.

Q: Can I open network sockets or access external network sources?
A: No.

Q: Can I read system properties?
A: No.

Q: Can I...
A: Probably not! ;)
