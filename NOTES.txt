TODO:
========================================================================================================================
User registration:
- Validate the email address at the domain class level
- Confirmation link for new user registration
- Additional information for user registration (ip, hostname, user agent)
- User edit functionality
- Add a registration password that will be announced in the presentation and add it to the sign-up form

Bot upload:
- Modify GlobalErrorController to show better message when upload size is too big
    - See also: http://www.mkyong.com/spring-boot/spring-boot-file-upload-example/
- Don't show a 500 error page when something goes south, but rather a error message in the upload form
- Validate that two different users don't have bots with the same class name
    - Otherwise both bot classes can't be loaded at the same time in the match process jvm

Match runtime process:
- How to disable reflection?
    - Can be disabled using a SecurityManager and catching the SecurityException
- Use a JSON file to communicate match results back to the web app
- Use a library to de/serialize the match turn results to/from a file

Web access log:
- Simple web access log
- Tag requests with unique id and show this id in log output to find the matching requests

Mailing:
- Switch to HTML e-mails with templates rendered by Thymeleaf (bonus)
- create an e-group and add the external e-mail addresses by hand in order to send e-mails on behalf of grid.wars
    - Mails can be sent and received using OWA and the service account: https://mmm.cern.ch/owa/

API & Impl:
- Clean up and reformat code

Bots:
- Clean up rubbish in core/bots and add new example bots
- Have the project use the emulator module for playing matches

Emulator:
- Rename "Visualizer" into "Emulator" and put it into its own module
- Create a new example/starter module that will be downloadable

Misc:
- Add Spring Actuators for features like adjust logging etc: http://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-actuators

- Implement functionality to block bot upload, user registration, and to stop/start match processing
    - Could be simple admin controller actions

- Have logs also printed to files under "work/logs"
    - dated and rolling logs?
    - Only when running as a jar and not with bootRun...


Functionality that I can avoid to create:
========================================================================================================================
- Forgot password: They should mail me, I will reset the password to a new one
    - I still need to bcrypt it, so there must be such an admin functionality...
    - Users must be able to change their password though

Info:
========================================================================================================================
- Service account: gridwars Fiba-Raxi
