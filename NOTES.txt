TODO:
========================================================================================================================
User registration:
- Validate the email address at the domain class level
- Confirmation link for new user registration
    - Bypass if an admin created the user
- Additional information for user registration (ip, hostname, user agent)
- User edit functionality
- Add a registration password that will be announced in the presentation and add it to the sign-up form

Bot upload:
- Don't show a 500 error page when something goes south, but rather a error message in the upload form

Error handling:
- Do not render error html pages on ajax request errors in controller methods
- Modify GlobalErrorController to show better message when upload size is too big
    - See also: http://www.mkyong.com/spring-boot/spring-boot-file-upload-example/

Match runtime process:
- How to disable reflection?
    - Can be disabled using a SecurityManager and catching the SecurityException

Web access log:
- Simple web access log
    - Could simply use the trace actuator?
- Tag requests with unique id and show this id in log output to find the matching requests

Mailing:
- Switch to HTML e-mails with templates rendered by Thymeleaf (bonus)

API & Impl:
- Clean up and reformat code
- Re-implement turn threads using completeable futures to enforce timeout
- How can I limit the output to sysout/syserr?
    - Maybe own implementation or wrapper of PrintWriter that counts the characters and stops the output when limit was reached...?

Bots:
- Clean up rubbish in core/bots and add new example bots
- Have the project use the emulator module for playing matches

Emulator:
- Rename "Visualizer" into "Emulator" and put it into its own module
- Create a new example/starter module that will be downloadable

DB:
- Check how to use a file for H2 db
- add a password when using in production file mode

UI:
- Create a CERN CA signed certificate that can be used for HTTPS
- Test if the interface appears to be save from injection and XSS attacks
- Consider using a fancy bootstrap theme to nicen up the look&feel: https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-dashboard
- Add a footer

Misc:
- Prepare some shell aliases on the gridwars machine to quickly list match processes etc.

- Add Spring Actuators for features like adjust logging etc: http://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-actuators

- Implement functionality to block bot upload, user registration, and to stop/start match processing
    - Could be simple admin controller actions that modify the gridwars properties (or actuator?)

- Have logs also printed to files under "work/logs"
    - dated and rolling logs?
    - Only when running as a jar and not with bootRun...


Functionality that I can avoid to create:
========================================================================================================================
- Forgot password: They should mail me, I will reset the password to a new one
    - I still need to bcrypt it, so there must be such an admin functionality...
    - Users must be able to change their password though
